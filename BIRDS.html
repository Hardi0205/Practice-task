                <h3>Kingfishers</h3>
                <p>Kingfishers are a family, the Alcedinidae, of small to medium-sized, brightly coloured birds in
                    the
                    order Coraciiformes.
                    They have a cosmopolitan distribution, with most species living in the tropical regions of
                    Africa,
                    Asia, and Oceania, but also can be seen in Europe.
                    They can be found in deep forests near calm ponds and small rivers. The family contains 116
                    species
                    and is divided into three subfamilies and 19 genera.
                    All kingfishers have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Most
                    species have bright plumage with only small differences between the sexes.
                    Most species are tropical in distribution, and a slight majority are found only in forests.

                <h3>Peacock</h3>
                <p>The Indian peafowl (Pavo cristatus), also known as the common peafowl, and blue peafowl, is a
                    peafowl species native to the Indian subcontinent.
                    It has been introduced to many other countries.
                    Male peafowl are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens,
                    although
                    both sexes are often referred to colloquially as a "peacock".
